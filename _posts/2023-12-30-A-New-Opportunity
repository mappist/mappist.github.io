Today was my first day as a Data and Mapping Analyst with the Department of [Neighborhood & Business Development](https://www.syr.gov/Departments/NBD)!

I'm so ecited for this opportunity. After my years of teaching, I've been eager for GIS work that remains focused on community well-being and equity. The job will include mapping, scripting (in R) to automate reporting, maintaining databases and writing documentation. I'm told that down the road will also be opportunities to serve on various committees and task forces.
