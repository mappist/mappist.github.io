This weekend the American Association of Geographers convened. A map from my thesis research took second place in the Cartography Specialty Group's Student Poster Competition! Gratitude to the CSG, the Onondaga Historical Association (whose archives were instrumental for this work), and my mentor, Dr. Jenn Bernstein. You can view my poster below.
