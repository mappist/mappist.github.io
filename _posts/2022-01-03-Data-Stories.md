If you know my work, you know I love maps *and* stories. I'll geek out about literature as much as I will about data. It's important to me that I find work that integrates my work in education + the arts with my new skills with maps + data. Starting this week, I'll be doing some work as a curriculum developer with [Data Stories](datastories.cc). The organization is devoted to "exploring the world through data and storytelling" -- using real-world data and engaging storytelling in the service of social engagement. I'm thrilled!

I'll share more in the coming months!
