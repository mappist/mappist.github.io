My name is Caleb Winebrenner.

I'm a [polymath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath) -- that means I've done several things with a lot of depth. There's a few things I'm especially passionate about, which I'll talk about here.

### Storytelling

As humans, we make sense of our place in the world through stories. From oral traditions to histoical archives, we (collectively, as a species) use narratives as a cognitive multi-tool. Stories identify who we are, why we are here, and what we hope to accomplish. Stories also operate on multiple scales, from an individual's biography to the macro-narrative of an entire culture, people, or nation.
