My name is Caleb Winebrenner. I hold an MA in Educational Theatre and an MS in Geographic Information Science & Technology.

I'm a [polymath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath) -- that means I've done several things with a lot of depth. Two of my big passions are telling stories and making maps. My work in one area is informed by my work in the other, and when I can I love to explore the overlap between the two.

## Storytelling

As humans, we make sense of our place in the world through stories. From oral traditions to historical archives, we (collectively, as a species) use narratives as a cognitive multi-tool. Stories identify who we are, why we are here, and what we hope to accomplish. Stories also operate on multiple scales, from an individual's biography to the macro-narrative of an entire culture, people, or nation. As a storyteller, I'm interested in folklore and literature that explore the relationships between our individual and collective experiences. Stories ignite the imagination, including the ways in which we can imagine wiser and more generous futures.

Relatedly, I'm also interested in the ways in which storytelling methods serve as memory cues for culturally-transmitted knowledge. For example, one of my favorite novels is Italo Calvino's _Invisible Cities_. The book is framed as memories from Marco Polo's travels, while on another level the descriptions of cities evoke more universal understandings of the human heart and mind. As another example, the Mayan _Popul Vuh_ is not only beautiful epic poetry about important cultural heroes (something that would be remembered by that people), it's also an exploration of Mayan cosmology, belief, and connections to their landscapes.

## Mapping

Like stories, maps are a powerful way to frame (and sometimes limit) human knowledge.
